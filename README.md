# Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 5

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for the Kaggle challenge "[Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 5](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5/overview)". The goal of this challenge is to build a model that predicts the target variable based on provided features.

## Objective

Develop and evaluate machine learning models to accurately predict the target variable using the given dataset. The focus is on feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best possible performance.

## Data Description

The dataset includes the following files:

- `train.csv`: Training data with features and target variable.
- `test.csv`: Test data with features (no target variable).
- `sample_submission.csv`: Sample format for the submission file.

Each row in the dataset represents a data point with several features and a target variable. The goal is to use the training data to build a model that can predict the target for the test data.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution and relationships of features and target variable.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features, transform existing features, and select relevant features for modeling.

### 2. Model Development

- **Model Selection**: Evaluate various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting) to identify the best-performing model.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters using grid search or random search to improve performance.

### 3. Model Evaluation

- **Performance Metrics**: For this challenge the R2-Score is the performance metric
- **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of different models and select the best one for final submission.

### 4. Submission

- **Prediction**: Generate predictions for the test data using the final model.
- **Submission File**: Prepare the submission file in the required format and submit it to the Kaggle competition.

## Results

The final model achieved a competitive performance on the test data. The key results and performance metrics are summarized as follows:

- **Best Model**: Linear Regression with Cross Validation
- **Performance Metric**: 0.84514
- **Public Leaderboard Score**: 1626

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building and optimizing machine learning models for a predictive analytics challenge.
## Future Work

- **Feature Importance**: Analyze feature importance to understand the key drivers of the target variable.
- **Advanced Models**: Explore advanced models and ensemble techniques to further improve performance.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the model and approach based on new insights and data.
